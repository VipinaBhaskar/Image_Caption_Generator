# Image_Caption_Generator
The caption generator utilizing CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory). The CNN model Xception, which was trained on the Imagenet dataset, will be used to extract the features from the image. These features will then be fed into the LSTM model, which will produce the captions for the images.
Encoder decoder architecture .CNN encoder and RNN decoder.

For the image caption generator, we will be using the Flickr_8K dataset.
